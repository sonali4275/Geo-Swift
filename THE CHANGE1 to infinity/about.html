        Water level rise is a phenomenon that occurs when the level of water in oceans, seas, lakes, and other bodies of water increases over time. This can be caused by a number of factors, including global warming, which causes the melting of polar ice caps and glaciers, and thermal expansion, which occurs when water
         is heated and its volume increases. The consequences of water level rise can be significant and 
         far-reaching, affecting everything from coastal cities and infrastructure to wildlife habitats and ecosystems.
          It can result in flooding, erosion, and the loss of land, and can also increase the frequency and severity of
           storms and other extreme weather events.The impacts of water level rise are already being felt around the world, and it is expected to continue and accelerate in the coming years unless significant action is taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate its effects.

      Deforestation is the permanent removal of forests and woodlands, often to make way for agricultural or industrial activities, or for human settlement.

     Deforestation has significant environmental impacts, including loss of biodiversity, soil erosion, increased greenhouse gas emissions, and reduced availability of clean water.

     Deforestation is a major contributor to climate change, accounting for around 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. This is because trees absorb and store carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas, from the atmosphere.

     Deforestation also has social and economic impacts, often affecting indigenous peoples and local communities who depend on forests for their livelihoods and cultural identity.
